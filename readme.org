#+title: Dotfiles

My dotfiles, managed using [[https://yadm.io][yadm]]. Currently macOS only, requires
[[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]] and Xcode or the Xcode Command Line Tools to be
installed. Also expects that SSH and GPG keys are setup as it enables
git commit signing by default.

See [[./docs]] for more info on specific parts, my goal is to have these
dotfiles generated entirely by Emacs org-mode and org-babel.

To install them run the following

#+begin_src shell
curl -fLo /tmp/yadm https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/raw/master/yadm && chmod a+x /tmp/yadm

/tmp/yadm clone --recursive https://github.com/willemml/dotfiles

zsh "$HOME/.config/yadm/bootstrap"
#+end_src
